## News:
* Aug 20th, 2025: R2D is accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main Conference.
* May 31st, 2025: Dataset released, and is available at [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chuhac/R2D-R1).
* Mar 9th, 2025: Code for R2D has been released. The dataset is currently being organized.
* Feb 18th, 2025: R2D's paper is publicly available at [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12970).


## Usage

### Training *R2D* Model

In order to better conduct Contrastive Pivot Optimization proposed in the paper, we expand the vocabularies before training.
```shell
cd r2d_train
bash expand_and_train.sh
```

### Evaluation

Weâ€™ve modified the original evaluation scripts provided by the benchmarks to make it easier to evaluate the performance of R2D models. These scripts can be found in the respective folders.
